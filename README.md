# job_platform

This project involves the development of a mobile application called the Disabled and Elderly Assistance Job Platform. Our aim is to provide fast and secure access to the services that elderly and disabled individuals need to make their daily lives easier. At the same time, it is to bring together individuals who will provide these services, especially students, on a reliable platform where they can earn additional income. Through the application, users will be able to create advertisements for daily tasks such as "Going to the pharmacy" and "Shopping at the market" for a certain fee. Service providers will be able to apply to these advertisements and complete the task determined by the employer. Employers will be able to evaluate service providers with a scoring system based on criteria such as speed, courtesy and reliability, thus creating a safer business model. This platform aims to make the lives of elderly and disabled individuals easier on the one hand, while providing financial support to students on the other, and to benefit both segments of society. The system, which will be designed as a user-friendly and accessible mobile application, will create a reliable service network and offer a business model that acts with a sense of social responsibility.
